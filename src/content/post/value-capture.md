## Average people climbing (cult)ture

There is no shame in choosing an approachable climb. We all begin somewhere, and difficulty is never the sole measure of worth. But there is rot in what follows: the cherry-picking of crags, the tallying of grades for social capital, the hollow boasts of being “closer on that V10 than a V4.” This is not climbing. This is résumé-building with rocks, the narrow, miserly ethos of the tech bro imported wholesale into our culture.

And it corrodes everything it touches. We see it in the crags overrun with poor etiquette, pads scattered like litter (literal pad-rotting in the Squamish forest), spotters who do not know how to spot (only a basic understanding of the pixie spot), trails worn down by careless traffic, carbon footprints swelling with every cross-country pilgrimage to the next double-digit trophy. We see it in the content: plastic masquerading as stone, Ashes V10 and Zero-Zero V10 chosen not for their movement but because they look like gym climbs on camera. We see it in the endless mimicry—Frankensteined beta, stitched together from videos, rehearsed until the send can be posted and monetized. This is not movement; it is spectacle. And it is exhausting.

Contrast this with the climbers who will preserve our culture. The strongest among us do not posture. They understand movement as a language—subtle, generous, plural—and they give it away. They unlock beta for short and tall alike. They establish climbs with integrity. When they break into grades, it is done in ways that honor the stone and honor themselves. Their ascents are honest. Their movement is honest. They give to their partners, their communities, the very rock itself. These are the climbers who last.

We have seen them: a five-foot-one climber who wrestled Thunderdome V10, a granite line infamous for punishing shorter frames, and refused to even claim the grade despite being capable of V12, V13. A PNW legend barely taller unlocking Ross Bongo, a sustained V8 that requires not brute strength but a decade of patience, intelligence, and craft. Climbs like these cannot be Frankensteined from a beta reel. They demand comprehension, subtlety, longevity. They demand respect.

And what do we see instead? Self-serving influencers renting months at a time to hurl themselves at double digits. Overprivileged, incurious, careless of safety, careless of space, careless of anyone but themselves. They are corroding our culture, substituting consumption for contribution, shallow spectacle for the generosity that once defined us. They are hollow apostles of a faith they will never understand.

It is pathetic. And it is exhausting. A grotesque pantomine. And unless we name it for what it is—unless we refuse to mistake spectacle for climbing—it will continue to erode the very thing we claim to love.
