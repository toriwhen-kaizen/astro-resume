## Projecting with friends
I’ve always wanted to work on something with friends. Maybe I got the idea from _Itaewon Class_ or _Dandadan_—the way a ragtag group comes together, through struggle and laughter, to build something that matters. A scrappy restaurant. A ghost-or-alien-hunting shop.

It’s not really about the restaurant or the shop. It’s about the people who choose the harder thing, together. Who show up for one another, even when it’s messy. Who make a small, hole-in-the-wall project feel bigger than themselves.

That’s the story I’ve always wanted to be part of.

## Career multi-tasking

> A big part of adulthood seemed to be checking email repeatedly.

_Real Americans, Rachel Khong_

Not going to sugarcoat it: it was rough. I had my full-time job, and then I had Climb NORA—its launch, its concept, its everything. Most weekends disappeared into it. Rest never felt like rest.

Even in bed, I’d drift off and then suddenly find something—an aesthetic, a vibe—that belonged to Climb NORA. I snapped photos compulsively. I filed things away for the brand, the space, the direction, the future. My mind was a mood board that never shut down.

If I wasn’t checking work emails, I was checking gym emails.

Sometimes I stayed up way too late messaging people on Alibaba in China about enamel pins—part of our grading and benchmarking system. (Turns out enamel pin manufacturing is illegal in the U.S., apparently because of counterfeit coins. Which makes sense, I guess. But also: who’s still using coins?)

## The backburner and acceptance, letting go

A lot of things had to go on the backburner. First: social life. I tried. I sent postcards, I sent memes. It’s easier to send a meme than to schedule a hangout. New friends? Forget it. I didn’t have the bandwidth. What I had, I spent on keeping old friendships alive, even if barely.

Climbing, too, slipped. One, maybe two sessions a week, if that. Sometimes I’d squeeze in lifting or conditioning. I’ve learned not to push when my body and brain are already at their limits. Still, it was hard—watching other people progress, go outdoors, be strong and healthy enough to keep moving forward while I felt stuck.

The truth is, I wasn’t setting myself up for much: inconsistent sleep, inconsistent eating, stress I couldn’t quite manage. So I let go.

I chose quality. Fewer climbs, but better ones. Technique, basics, rehab when I could. Tiny refinements. Enough to keep me going. Just trying to sustain my joy and love for movement, for climbing, for staying well.

## We're launching in a month, ahhhh (panick) - picking up all the trades

I had to learn how to animate. How to screenprint. None of it was in the plan, and none of it was easy. They look simple, these things, but the nuances—the tiny wrist movements, the timing, the little tricks—you don’t notice until you’re actually doing them. It’s funny how we take the act of doing something for granted. You think you know. You don’t. Not until your hands are in it, making mistakes, figuring it out, feeling it in a way that no YouTube tutorial can quite teach.

And now—the gym opens in a month. I can’t believe it. I’m excited, a little nervous, and endlessly grateful for all the support along the way.
